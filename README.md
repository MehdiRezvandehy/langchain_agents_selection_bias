# LangChain Agents and Selection Bias

This work introduces a framework to create AI agents with LangChain. Five agents are created. Then I present a framework to evaluate how effectively a large language model (LLM) can select the correct specialized agent to handle a given user question. I simulate a manager agent that routes each question to the most appropriate tool from a predefined list. The core objective is to assess the LLMâ€™s ability to reason about tool usage based on natural language queries, as well as to investigate the presence of positional bias in its decision-making.
